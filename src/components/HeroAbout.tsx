                            It all began with a simple dashboard.<br />
                            <br />
                            In 2022, as a Year 12 student, I built a Tableau dashboard 
                            visualising COVID border restrictions. It was just a school 
                            project, but something clicked. I was drawn to the process 
                            of transforming raw data into compelling visual stories. 
                            That project sparked my curiosity in data.<br />
                            <br />

                            For the past two years, I&apos;ve been studying data science at 
                            The University of Melbourne, learning how to extract insights 
                            from complex datasets and communicate them in ways that drive
                            impact. Now, as a third-year student, I&apos;ve realised that I 
                            love the dynamic nature of problem-solvingâ€”combining technical 
                            expertise with storytelling to support the bigger picture 
                            through data.<br />
                            <br />

                            But learning data science hasn&apos;t been smooth sailing. Like many STEM 
                            students, I struggled to bridge the gap between theory and 
                            practiceâ€”spending hours on formula proofs and debugging 
                            algorithms, unsure of the practical applications to real-world 
                            challenges.<br />
                            <br />

                            However, through hands-on projects and an internship, my pathway 
                            became clear: to become an adaptable data scientist who is 
                            equally skilled in computer science, mathematics, and business 
                            expertise. <br />
